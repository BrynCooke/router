### Support loading JWT from other sources ([PR #4711](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/4711))

The router supports the new `authentication.router.jwt.sources` option. It enables cookies as an alternative source for tokens and allows multiple alternative sources.

For details, see the [sources configuration option](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/authn-jwt#sources).
