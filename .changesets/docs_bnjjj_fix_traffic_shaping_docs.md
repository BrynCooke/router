### Document traffic shaping default configuration ([PR #4953](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/4953))

The documentation for [configuring traffic shaping](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/traffic-shaping#configuration) has been updated to clarify that it's enabled by default with preset values. This setting has been the default since PR [#3330](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/3330), which landed in [v1.23.0](https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases/tag/v1.23.0).
