### Document OpenTelemetry information for operation limits ([PR #5884](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/5884))

The router's docs for operation limits now describe [using telemetry to set operation limits](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/operation-limits#using-telemetry-to-set-operation-limits) and [logging values](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/operation-limits#logging-values).
