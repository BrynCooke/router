### Add headers to the JWKS download request ([Issue #4651](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/4651))

The router supports the new `authentication.router.jwt.jwks.headers` option for setting static headers on HTTP requests to download a JWKS from an identity provider.

For details, see the [JWKS configuration option](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/authn-jwt#jwks).
